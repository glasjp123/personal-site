	<p class='aboutme'>After attempting a minor in Computer Science at La Salle University and deciding it wasn't for me,<br> I distanced myself from learning to code.  Throughout the years since, I have made a few futile<br> attempts to learn things on my own but nothing ever seemed to stick.  Twelve years and several <br> different jobs in the insurance industry later, I am back in the classroom, learning to code, which<br> is something I never thought I could do.</p>

	<p>Heres a new sentence for git example.</p>
